# Rebar Inspection Sheet Generating Tool
A web-based tool for generating sheets for onsite rebar inspection. It speeds up the preparation of filling the design data of RC columns/beams into each inspection sheet by 5 times. Specifically, in conventional procedure, inspectors may spend couple hours to extract the design data from drawings and fill them into the sheets. This tool automatically extracts data from building information models and generate the sheets accordingly. Inspectors then bring all the sheets to conduct quality check of rebars.
